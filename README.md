This game was made for the 150 year party of my school.

Thanks to Topenga for the artwork and Ilya for the word dataset.

## Controls
- Press space to start game when on start screen
- Move with arrow keys
- Space to fire

## How to play
At the top of the screen is the word group you will have to shoot at.
A correct hit will give you 5 points (top right corner of screen), a wron hit will punish you with -5 points.
If you run into a word with your ship you will be punished with -10 points.

The words and word groups can be configured in the wortarten.json file. Just create named arrays of any type of word and it will automatically adjsut.

Example:
```
{
  "foo":["foobar_1", "foobar_2"],
  "bar":["foobar_3", "foobar_4"]
}
```
